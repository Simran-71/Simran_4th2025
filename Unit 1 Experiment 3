AIM : Write a Java program to create an Employee class where an Overloaded constructor initializes employee details.The default 
      constructor should Initialize name as "Unknown" and salary as 0 and the second constructor initializes the name and sets a 
      default salary. Create a method DisplayEmployeeDetails() to display employee information.

PROGRAM CODE :

// Employee Class
class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;

    // Default Constructor
    public Employee() {
        this.name = "Unknown"; // Default name
        this.salary = 0.0;     // Default salary
    }

    // Overloaded Constructor
    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = 30000.0; // Default salary
    }

    // Method to display employee details
    public void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + this.name);
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + this.salary);
    }
}

// Main Class
public class EmployeeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating employee using default constructor
        Employee emp1 = new Employee();
        System.out.println("Details of Employee 1:");
        emp1.displayEmployeeDetails();
        System.out.println();

        // Creating employee using overloaded constructor
        Employee emp2 = new Employee("Alice");
        System.out.println("Details of Employee 2:");
        emp2.displayEmployeeDetails();
    }
}


OUTPUT :
Details of Employee 1:
Employee Name: Unknown
Employee Salary: 0.0

Details of Employee 2:
Employee Name: Alice
Employee Salary: 30000.0
